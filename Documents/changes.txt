HOW I GOT LINE CHROME EXTENSION TO OPEN ON STARTUP:
1. wrote chrome app located ~/Code/openLineExtension
2. loaded chrome extension at chrome://extensions
    a. this required "Developer mode" to be on (top right corner)
    b. click "Load unpacked" and choose the openLineExtension directory
3. to get i3 to open it up in the correct workspace, i added: 'assign [instance="INSTANCE_HERE"] $ws3'
    a. to get the instance use the 'xprop' command and then click on the window - the first string under WM_WINDOW is the instance, the second is the class
